          logic, so adding terms has the effect of narrowing the search.

                mission: Home For Life is an expression of a new kind of animal shelter
                  - the long-term animal sanctuary. We provide animals with loving
                  care, a nurturing environment that is safe and stable, a place to
                  belong- a home for life. We provide lifetime care for cats and dogs
                  with special needs who cannot find a home, but who can still lead
                  a quality life. We believe that animals should live in a setting
                  that is appropriately scaled to allow for individual attention and
                  specialized care. This is why Home For Life is able to give its
                  residents a quality life and not just a warehoused existence.

        ceoCompensationPercent:
          type: number
          description: |-
            Based on the data found in each charity's most recently filed Form 990, we include salary,
            cash bonuses, and expense accounts when we measure a CEO's compensation. We do not include
            contributions to benefit plans or deferred compensation that is allocated to be paid in later
            years. Deferred compensation is often accrued over many years and then is paid as a lump sum in
            one year. As such, we do include deferred compensation as part of the compensation figure in the
            year in which it is actually paid out to the employee and/or when it is expensed per the 990.
            Many charities use fiscal years that differ from the calendar year. In these cases, it is
            important to recognize that the CEO’s compensation reported on the Form 990 reflects the CEO’s
            pay for the calendar year, not the fiscal year. Why? Because the IRS requires that charities
            report compensation on the Form 990 exactly the same as they did on the W-2 Form
            (which is based on the calendar year).
            Many donors are understandably interested in how much the leaders of charities earn. This information
            is public record so Charity Navigator reports it for our users. This information does not factor
            into an organization's Charity Navigator rating. We provide this percentage so donors can quickly put
            the salary into perspective. For comparative purposes, a charity with total expenses of $20 million,
            which compensates its highest paid executive at $200,000 per year (or 1%) would appear to have tighter
            control on expenses than the $1 million organization which pays its chief executive the same amount
            (or 20% of expenses for one person). [Learn
